Distributions to include:

1. PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) Distribution

   - Useful when you have estimates for minimum, most likely, and maximum
     values, with a tendency to weight the most likely value more heavily.

2. Triangular Distribution

   - Ideal when you have estimates for minimum, most likely, and maximum values,
     but less certainty about the weight of the most likely value compared to
     PERT.

3. Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

   - Appropriate for natural phenomena and when you expect values to be
     symmetrically distributed around a mean.

4. Log-Normal Distribution

   - Suitable for modeling quantities that are always positive and have a skewed
     distribution, such as project durations or costs.

5. Uniform Distribution

   - Used when all values between a minimum and maximum are equally likely,
     often in the absence of more specific information.

6. Beta Distribution

   - Flexible for modeling various shapes of uncertainty, especially useful when
     historical data is available to fit the distribution.

7. Gamma Distribution

   - Often used for modeling waiting times or project durations, especially when
     the distribution is skewed to the right.

8. Weibull Distribution

   - Commonly used in reliability analysis and for modeling time-to-failure in
     projects or systems.

9. Exponential Distribution

   - Useful for modeling the time between independent events, such as time
     between failures in a system.

10. Discrete Uniform Distribution

    - Applicable when dealing with a finite number of equally likely outcomes,
      such as selecting from a set of discrete options.
